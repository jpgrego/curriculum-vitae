\small{Working student, currently writing the Master's dissertation to
  complete the course of Computers and Telematics Engineering in the University
  of Aveiro. Passionate for software development and systems administration,
  with strong technical and social skills. Determined to learn with those who
  know more, and to teach those who know less, with sharing information and the
  spreading of knowledge.}

\section{Professional Experience}

\vspace{6pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{July 2018 -- Present}{Systems Engineer}{University of
      Aveiro}{Aveiro}{Information Systems and Communications Group}{Part of the
      team that is responsible for systems management and
      administration. Specializes in the maintenance and troubleshooting of
      machines based on GNU/Linux, as well as the development of new solutions
      that are built upon this operating system. In collaboration with his team,
      he installed a new Glassfish solution, manages the MySQL / MariaDB and
      PostgreSQL databases, and administrates the load balancing solution based
      on Linux Virtual Server. He's also currently one of the members
      responsible for the current VoIP solution, and currently assisting in the
      testing and installation of the new one. Configures web servers like
      Apache across several machines, as well as application servers such as
      Tomcat and the aforementioned Glassfish. One of the main tasks at hand at
      this moment is introducing containerization, using Docker, collaborating
      in the paradigm change from a structure strongly built on virtual
      machines. Also contributing to the instalation on premises of a
      distributed streaming platform / message bus using Kafka. Lastly, he's
      part of the ``Computer Security Incident Response Team''
      (\url{https://csirt.ua.pt/page/24264}, ``Membros da Equipa'') of the
      institution, aiding in the analysis of cybersecurity incidents and the
      implementation of security policies.}}

\item{\cventry{November 2016 -- July 2018}{Software Engineer}{University of
      Aveiro}{Aveiro}{Open Platforms Group}{Took part in a innovative team
      resposible for the customization, instalation and maintenance of free and
      open source software solutions to be used by several departments of the
      institution, such as the internal management of information systems
      (\textit{WSO2}) and services available to the public (\textit{Moodle},
      \textit{DSpace}, \textit{OJS}, ...). Produced several bash scripts, some
      of which can be seen on the University of Aveiro GitHub's page
      (\url{https://www.github.com/universidadeaveiro/}). Managed several
      GNU/Linux development machines that belonged to the group, or that the
      group had access to. Before joining this team, he was responsible for the
      development of the backoffice for the mobile application relative to the
      project ``IES + Perto'', improving the already existing web services, and
      creating new ones. He was also responsible for the improvement of
      functionalities and bug fixing of an Android application, to be used by
      the security personnel of the university campus. Consistently elaborated
      documentation using LaTeX and LibreOffice, describing step-by-step the
      installation of platforms and development environments.}}

\item{\cventry{April 2015 -- October 2016}{Software
      Engineer}{BEEVERYCREATIVE}{Aveiro}{}{Joined the team responsible for the
      development of software and firmware used in BEEVERYCREATIVE's printers, a
      portuguese 3D printer designer. Maintained existing projects,
      significantly improving their stability and usability, and developed new
      ones, with collaboration with external entities, such as the European
      Space Agency.}}

\subsection{Projects}

\vspace{5pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{MSc thesis (in progress): } \textit{'Integrated
      monitoring in Android Devices'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{Currently elaborating the finishing touches in the elaboration of a
  monitoring system for the Android operating system. It consists in an
  application with the purpose of analysing the device's activity and,
  afterwards, attempt to detect events that deviate too far from that which is
  established to be the normal operation and behaviour of the cell phone. This
  work is, then, an attempt to present an alternative in the detection of
  malware in mobile devices. Wrote a paper about this work for the
  \textit{ConfTele} conference, organized by the Institute of
  Telecommunications, located in the University of Aveiro campus.}}

\item{\textbf{\nth{3} year project: } \textit{'Attendance control'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This project had the purpose of developing an efficient method to
  automatically register the class and exams attendance of students. After the
  formal presentation of the project, the team responsible for it still met with
  the Information Technology Services of the University of Aveiro, in order to
  officialy implement the system.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Software Engineering course project: }\textit{'Cambada
      in the Web'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This was a course of the MSc curriculum. In collaboration with
  CAMBADA (\textit{Cooperative Autonomous Mobile roBots with Advanced
    Distributed Architecture}), the famous robotic football of the University of
  Aveiro, he helped develop a web platform for the visualization of statistics
  and record ongoing games.}}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Services Engineering course project: }\textit{'eLock'}

\vspace{3pt}

\small{This was a course of the MSc curriculum. eLock was developed during the
  attendance of this course. The objective was to build a system of electronic
  locks, safe, eficient and customizable. It allowed the user to open the lock
  with his mobile device and to authorize other people to open the lock, even
  allowing to set a schedule in which said user could open it (say, every day
  around 15 and 16). Mainly built in Java, it assented in technologies like
  RabbitMQ, hosted in a GNU/Linux System}}

\section{Hobbies}

\vspace{6pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{Really invested in the GNU/Linux world, tinkering with the systems he uses
    as an hobby. Currently using Gentoo in his personal laptop and Debian on his
    work ones. As a consequence, has great affinity for free (as in freedom)
    software in general. Although only submitting small bug fixes so far, he
    plans on being active in the development and maintenance of free software
    projects in the future, specially if these are tools that he uses in his day
    job.}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{When he's not nerding out in the computer, playing with his personal
    servers, and read on the latest developments, he steps out of the computer
    engineering for a bit and studies political and ethical philosophy.}
